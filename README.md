# Lock it In

In the best engineering organizations, continuous learning is part of the software development and deployment cycle. This is achieved by team leads who cultivate a safe learning environment, and those who use teaching techniques to speed up the learning of their junior and mid-level engineers.

In this interactive workshop, you'll learn and practice 3 high-impact teaching techniques from Doug Lemov's manual [Practice Perfect](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Perfect-Rules-Getting-Better/dp/111821658X). You'll leave the workshop ready to coach your team and mentor with confidence, using the techniques [Lock It In](https://github.com/relentful/Lock-It-In), Analyze the Game, [Replace Your Purpose with an Objective](https://github.com/relentful/Replace-Your-Purpose-with-an-Objective).

This workshop is designed for anyone who wants to help foster the development and growth of other engineers. Executives who are thinking about how to build and grow their software teams, Senior Engineers who want to coach and teach engineers with confidence and junior engineers who want to get better at coaching themselves and their peers.

## Outcomes
_By the end of this workshop, you will:_
1. Demonstrate three ways of asking someone to ‘Lock It In’
1. Describe the purpose of using ‘Lock It In’ with a mentee or direct report
1. Demonstrate checking for understanding by using one of the ‘Lock it In’ prompts
1. (Stretch) Identify scenarios where you want your mentee to prioritize feedback vs. summarize or describe their next action
